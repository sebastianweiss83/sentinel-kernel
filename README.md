# sentinel-kernel

**The Sovereign Decision Trace & Policy Layer.**

Sentinel sits between your business logic and any autonomous decision
system. It records every decision — sovereign, tamper-resistant,
append-only — and enforces what is allowed to be decided.

Works with LLMs, ML classifiers, rule engines, and robotic systems.
If it decides, Sentinel records it.

**Honest scope.** Sentinel is the enforcement and evidence layer
for EU AI Act Art. 12 (logging), Art. 13 (transparency), Art. 14
(human oversight), and Art. 17 (quality management traceability).
It does **not** replace risk management (Art. 9), data governance
(Art. 10), technical documentation (Art. 11), accuracy and
robustness controls (Art. 15), or conformity assessment and
post-market monitoring. Those are organisational obligations
above this layer. See [docs/eu-ai-act.md](docs/eu-ai-act.md) for the
full scoping note.

Three layers:

- **Trace** — every decision recorded, sovereign, tamper-resistant
- **Govern** — what may be decided, policy-as-code, kill switch
- **Route** *(v4.0)* — which system decides what, based on sovereignty
  policy and data classification

No vendor lock-in. No US CLOUD Act. No deployment strategists.
Apache 2.0, permanently.

EU AI Act Annex III enforcement: **2 August 2026**. Sentinel turns that
legal requirement into a technical fact — in five minutes, with zero
cloud dependencies, in any environment including air-gapped.

**Live preview:** https://sebastianweiss83.github.io/sentinel-kernel/
**Get started in 2 minutes:** [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)

## Quick start

```bash
# macOS (recommended)
brew install pipx && pipx install sentinel-kernel
sentinel demo

# Linux / Docker / CI
pip install sentinel-kernel
sentinel demo

# Alternative (always works)
python3 -m pip install sentinel-kernel
python3 -m sentinel demo
```

### Full-stack demo (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebastianweiss83/sentinel-kernel
cd sentinel-kernel/demo
docker compose up --build
```

Then open **http://localhost:3001** (Grafana, `admin` / `sentinel`).

The demo runs a realistic EU defence contractor scenario — policy
evaluation, kill switch (Art. 14), document analysis, sovereignty
scan — and streams live traces to Grafana. See
[demo/README.md](demo/README.md) for what to look at.

## Install

```bash
# macOS (recommended — avoids PEP 668 "externally-managed-environment")
brew install pipx
pipx install sentinel-kernel
sentinel demo

# Linux / Docker / CI
pip install sentinel-kernel
sentinel demo

# Alternative (always works)
python3 -m pip install sentinel-kernel
python3 -m sentinel demo
```

`python3 -m sentinel` is equivalent to the `sentinel` entry point and always
works, even on systems where the bin directory is not on PATH.

## Five minutes to your first sovereign trace

```python
from sentinel import Sentinel

sentinel = Sentinel()  # local storage, zero config, no network

@sentinel.trace
async def approve_request(payload: dict) -> dict:
    # your existing agent logic — unchanged
    return await your_agent.run(payload)

result = await approve_request({"action": "approve", "amount": 50000})
```

That's it. Every call now produces a tamper-resistant decision record:

```json
{
  "trace_id": "01hx7k9m2n3p4q5r6s7t8u9v0w",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-01T14:23:41.234Z",
  "agent": "approve_request",
  "model": "mistral/large-2",
  "policy_result": "ALLOW",
  "inputs_hash": "sha256:a3f8c2d19e4b67f0c1a5d8e2b9c3f4a7",
  "output": {"decision": "approved"},
  "sovereign_scope": "EU",
  "data_residency": "local",
  "schema_version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Stored locally. No cloud account. No API key. No network call.

---

## With policy evaluation

```python
from sentinel import Sentinel, DataResidency
from sentinel.policy import SimpleRuleEvaluator
from sentinel.storage import FilesystemStorage

def within_threshold(ctx: dict) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
    if ctx.get("amount", 0) > ctx.get("agent_threshold", 0):
        return False, "amount_exceeds_threshold"
    return True, None

# works fully offline — classified environments, air-gapped networks
sentinel = Sentinel(
    storage=FilesystemStorage("/mnt/traces"),
    policy_evaluator=SimpleRuleEvaluator({
        "policies/procurement.py": within_threshold,
    }),
    sovereign_scope="EU",
    data_residency=DataResidency.EU_DE,
)

@sentinel.trace(policy="policies/procurement.py")
async def evaluate_procurement(ctx: dict) -> dict:
    return await agent.run(ctx)
```

For OPA/Rego policies:

```python
from sentinel import Sentinel
from sentinel.policy import LocalRegoEvaluator

sentinel = Sentinel(
    policy_evaluator=LocalRegoEvaluator(opa_binary="opa"),
    # OPA runs in-process — no network, no OPA server
)

@sentinel.trace(policy="policies/procurement.rego")
async def evaluate_procurement(ctx: dict) -> dict:
    return await agent.run(ctx)
```

## What Sentinel does. What it doesn't.

| | Sentinel | Cloud observability tools | Proprietary platforms |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sovereign decision records | ✓ | — | Vendor-jurisdicted |
| In-process policy evaluation | ✓ | — | — |
| Air-gapped operation | ✓ | — | — |
| BSI IT-Grundschutz path | ✓ | — | — |
| EU AI Act Art. 12/13/14/17 evidence layer | ✓ | — | Partial |
| Zero hard dependencies | ✓ | — | — |
| Apache 2.0 permanently | ✓ | Varies | — |
| US CLOUD Act exposure | **None** | Varies | **Unconditional** |

Sentinel is not an observability tool. It is not a content filter. It does not replace your LLM, your ML model, or your rule engine — it does not care which technology makes the decision. It wraps any Python function and produces a legally-valid, portable, sovereign record of every decision it makes.

---

## Deployment

**Local / development**
```python
sentinel = Sentinel()  # SQLite, no config
```

**On-premise enterprise**
```python
from sentinel import Sentinel, DataResidency
from sentinel.storage import SQLiteStorage

sentinel = Sentinel(
    storage=SQLiteStorage("/var/lib/sentinel/traces.db"),
    sovereign_scope="EU",
    data_residency=DataResidency.EU_DE,
)
# For PostgreSQL: from sentinel.storage.postgres import PostgresStorage
```

**Air-gapped / classified**
```python
from sentinel import Sentinel, DataResidency
from sentinel.storage import FilesystemStorage

sentinel = Sentinel(
    storage=FilesystemStorage("/mnt/traces"),
    data_residency=DataResidency.AIR_GAPPED,
)
# zero network connectivity required
# traces written as NDJSON, one file per day
```

---

## Why sovereignty matters

The US CLOUD Act (18 U.S.C. § 2713) requires US-incorporated companies to produce data stored anywhere in the world on valid legal process. This applies to EU data centres operated by US companies. No contract eliminates it.

EU AI Act Article 12 mandates automatic, tamper-resistant logging for high-risk AI systems from **2 August 2026**. Decision logs that are simultaneously accessible to US authorities do not satisfy this requirement from EU jurisdiction.

Sentinel's critical path — interceptor, policy evaluation, trace emission, storage — contains no US-owned components. This is architectural. Not a configuration option.

| Art. 12 | Auto logging | ✓ Full — automated |
| Art. 13 | Transparency | ✓ Full — automated |
| Art. 14 | Human oversight | ✓ Full — kill switch |
| Art. 9  | Risk management | ~ Partial — policy traces |
| Art. 11 | Technical docs | → Human action — Annex IV required |
| Art. 17 | Quality mgmt | ✓ Full — continuous record |
| Art. 16 | Provider obligations | ~ Partial — logging covered |
| Art. 26 | Deployer obligations | ~ Partial — logging + oversight |
| Art. 10 | Data governance | → Human action |
| Art. 15 | Accuracy | → Human action |
| Art. 72 | GPAI (if applicable) | ~ Conditional |

**Sentinel never overclaims.** Articles requiring human action are
clearly marked. Partial articles are those where Sentinel produces
the evidence but an organisational deliverable must still be written.

Enforcement for Annex III high-risk AI: **2 August 2026**. Penalties up to €15M or 3% of global annual turnover.

## Runtime Briefing

[Sentinel Runtime Briefing](/docs/runtime-briefing.html) — interactive architecture explainer.

## Why it works for any autonomous system

The EU AI Act does not regulate language models. It regulates decisions.
Article 12 requires automatic, tamper-resistant logging of every decision
made by a high-risk system — regardless of the technology underneath.

An LLM, a gradient-boosted classifier, a rule engine, an industrial
robot: if it makes a high-risk decision, it needs a sovereign decision
record.

```python
# Works with any decision function
@sentinel.trace
async def my_decision(context: dict) -> dict:
    return await any_system.decide(context)
    # LLM, ML model, rule engine, robot control system
    # Sentinel doesn't care. It records the decision.
```

## Why not Palantir AIP

Palantir AIP costs €5–20M per year. It is US-incorporated (CLOUD Act
applies to all your data). It requires deployment strategists. It is
proprietary.

When LLMs guide their own integration — and that is already happening —
the deployment-strategist model collapses. What survives is the trusted
kernel underneath: policy, audit trail, model router, sovereignty proof.

Sentinel is that kernel. Open source. EU sovereign. Self-service.
Apache 2.0, permanently. The full argument is in [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md).

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR.

Every integration must document its sovereignty posture. Schema changes require an RFC. Breaking changes to the trace format go through a 14-day comment period.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebastianweiss83/sentinel-kernel
cd sentinel-kernel
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

## License

Apache 2.0. [Full text.](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

No BSL. No commercial-only features. No relicensing. Ever.

---

## Governance

Sentinel is pursuing stewardship under **Linux Foundation Europe**. Until confirmed, the project is maintained independently with all significant decisions made through the RFC process in GitHub Discussions.

---

## Plug into CI/CD in 3 lines

```yaml
- run: pip install sentinel-kernel
- run: sentinel ci-check --manifesto manifesto.py:MyManifesto
```

`sentinel ci-check` runs the EU AI Act snapshot, the runtime
sovereignty scan, and (optionally) a manifesto check in-process,
with one aggregate exit code. Fully offline, air-gapped capable.
GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and pre-commit snippets in
[docs/ci-cd-integration.md](docs/ci-cd-integration.md).

For auditors: `sentinel evidence-pack --output audit.pdf` generates
a signed, self-contained PDF evidence pack with EU AI Act / DORA /
NIS2 coverage, trace hash manifest, and sovereign attestation
appendix. Install via `pip install sentinel-kernel[pdf]`.

---

## Commercial support

The `sentinel-kernel` layer is Apache 2.0 forever. Commercial support
— deployment assistance, audit preparation, BSI pre-engagement,
custom policy libraries, incident response, SLA — is available for
regulated organisations that need an accountable party behind the
infrastructure. No hosted SaaS, no commercial fork, no CLOUD Act
exposure. Contact via GitHub Issues until a formal channel exists.
See [docs/commercial.md](docs/commercial.md).
